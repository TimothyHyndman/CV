Starting with over 100GB of raw transaction data, I developed predictive models, for short term fuel volume forecasts at candidate prices, as well as predictive models for in store purchases and long term effects of difference pricing strategies. I was one of two developers for the final software, and helped deploy the solution to the client's Azure infrastructure. The solution is currently in a trial phase and being used at approximately 80 stores Australia wide.",
  "Data scientist", "Biarri", "Windsor, Australia", "May. 2019 - Present", "Developed tool to suggest `optimal' markdown prices for a group of sport and outdoor retailers. The challenge was to suggest a price that would allow them to get rid of stock within an allocated time while maximising profit. After two trial implementations, the net increase in margin was measured at approximately $200k or 20%.",

  "Data scientist", "Biarri", "Windsor, Australia", "May. 2019 - Present", "I have also developed ranking algorithms for a competitor form of Poker, performed performance analysis on a 3rd party's electricity forecasting algorithms, and determined factors that correlated with poor sales growth for an outdoor activities retailer.",
  # "Statistical Consultant", "Biarri", "Windsor, Australia", "Nov. 2018", "Two week intership as a statistical consultant for Biarri optimisation. I delivered analysis on a clien't sales data and identified factors that correlated with poor sales growth. The project involved cleaning and wrangling approximately 20GB of data; aggregating relevant data appropriately; using techniques such as seasonal trend decomposition, arima models, and regression models; and presenting these result in an intuitive graphical way.",
